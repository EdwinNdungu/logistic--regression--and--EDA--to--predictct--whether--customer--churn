Introduction
Churn modeling is a process used by companies to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving or churning. This information is used to improve customer retention and prevent churn.

In this guide, we will use a sample dataset to train and evaluate a churn model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Importing the necessary libraries

        
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score 
        

Step 2: Loading the dataset

      
      dataset = pd.read_csv("churn_data.csv")
      
Step 3: Exploring the dataset

      dataset.head()
      dataset.describe()
      dataset.info()
      
Step 4: Preprocessing the data

      
      X = dataset.iloc[:, 3:-1].values
      y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

      X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

      sc = StandardScaler()
      X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
      X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
      
Step 5: Training the model

      
      classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0)
      classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
      
Step 6: Making predictions and evaluating the model

      
      y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

      cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
      print(cm)

      accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
      print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
      
Conclusion
With this guide, you should now have a basic understanding of how to create a churn model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The code provided here is just a starting point and can be improved upon by experimenting with different algorithms and techniques.
